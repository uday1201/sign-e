#what we have done till now

1) we have designed our circuit and implemented it on Aurdino 
2) We have used following sensors to detect gesture properly
	1) Gyrosensor 
	2) Accelero Sensor
	3) Flex sensor

3) All the sensors are sync and real time sensor readings are being sent to the host device 

4) we have initated machine learning algorithms wherein using learn.py file ,we can train our model for dif.jestures whereas do.py file predicts them
do.py file acts as a library which can be intergrated in any use case 

#What is remaining

All we have to do is to improve accuracy of our trained model
